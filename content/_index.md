Welcome to My Personal/Professional Blog

Here  I aim to document the various challenges I encounter on my journey through both my professional and hobby life. I'll be creating blog posts about these experiences, with the hope that they might be useful to someone, somewhere in the future.

## About Me

I have a passion for technologies, tackling technical challenges, and programming. As a big fan of open sourcing, I actively engage in the community. Linux holds a special place in my heart, serving as my primary operating system. My journey from a dual-boot setup with Linux Mint to embracing NixOS as my main system was filled with data losses, boot failures, and other amusing adventures.

I'm a Senior Software Engineer, specializing in C++. However, I'm open to gaining experience and working with different languages. Since 2021, I've been working full-time with the Crystal programming language, finding it rather charming. Python, being my first programming language (thanks to the duck syndrome), remains my go-to language for prototyping or as a glue for various projects.

I'm inspired by self-driving technologies, computer vision, machine learning, and the application of AI in different aspects of human life. A self-hosting enthusiast, I strive to own all my data whenever possible.

As of 2022, I've embraced the digital nomad lifestyle, not having a fixed place of residence until I can safely return to my city, Odessa.
